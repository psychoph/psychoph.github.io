I started playing [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends) last week with some friends, midway into Season 7. I have enjoyed the game as a break from Fortnite. I like that it is cross-platform. I don't particularly appreciate playing FPSs on PS4, obviously preferring a keyboard and mouse. I do wish that they were like Fortnite and have cross-platform progress. I lost a lot of twitch prime bonuses to my PS4 account because I logged in there first. I am still horrible at it, but as a free-to-play game, it is worth a playthrough. I do like the multiple classes compared to the static characters in Fortnite.

I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because one didn't exist. Although I get the main ability mixed up with using a medical or shield booster, the profile works well. I have jump and melee on my mouse. Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout I created.
