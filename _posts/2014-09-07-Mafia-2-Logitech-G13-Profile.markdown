[Mafia 2](http://www.mafia2game.com/) is a pretty fun game. It is a lot like Grand Theft Auto only set in the 50s and probably with a lot less car jacking. The [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) works really well for the game since it is a third person shooter. I made a profile for the Logitech G13 that has worked well for the game. It is a basic FPS style profile with a few extra keys added to the game specifically for climbing, hostering, crouching anc covering. Below is an image of the keyboard layout for the profile.
