I got some loot boxes for [Paragon](https://www.epicgames.com/paragon/en-US/news/) as part of one of the [Humble Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/) I bought (think it was the E3 bundle for 2017). I have been really enjoying the game. It is a great MOBA with lots of different types of characters to play. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because one didn't exist. IThe profile works well and is similar to a typical FPS setup for me. The ability buttons are the non standard FPS buttons and they are in easy to reach places.
