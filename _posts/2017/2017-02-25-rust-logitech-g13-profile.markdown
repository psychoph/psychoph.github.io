excerpt: "Rust is an interesting game. It is more fun if you don't get killed within the first 15 minutes. This profile has worked for me so far but the longest I survived was 2 hours."

I picked up [Rust](http://playrust.com/) from the [Survive Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) probably a year ago now. I haven't played a lot of the game. I think the longest I played without someone killing me was 2 hours. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because that is what I do at this point unless the game works with my xbox 360 controller. For this game I keyed up all of the slots I could and moved around the crafting area. The use and crafting seem to be the main controls until you get to a point that you can kill other players. As I never tried to kill another player I would say crafting is probably more important. Hunting with a bow is useful too. Below is the screen shot of the profile settings.
