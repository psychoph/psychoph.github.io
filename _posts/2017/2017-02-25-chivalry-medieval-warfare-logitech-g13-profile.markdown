excerpt: "I was able to play the beta of For Honor and I found it enjoyable once I got used to the controls. This profile should provide all the keys needed in the right spots for how often you will use them."

I played [Chivalry Medieval Warfare](http://www.tornbanner.com/chivalry/) from the [Humble Staff Picks Bundle: Glen](https://www.humblebundle.com). I enjoyed the game and had played a free weekend a while back. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because that is what I do at this point unless the game works with my xbox 360 controller. The profile works well and is similar to a typical FPS setup for me. There aren't many unique keys (feitns and dodge seems to be it). Below is an image of the keyboard layout I use.
