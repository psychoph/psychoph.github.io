I picked up [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/) from the [Survive Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com) probably a year ago now. I haven't played a lot of the game. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because that is what I do at this point unless the game works with my xbox 360 controller. I am not positive this is the layout I will stay with because I haven't played it enough to know if I have the most common keys I would use in the right places. Mostly the current profile allows me to move around correctly and access the early game controls I needed. Below is the keyboard layout as it stands.

I might make a new post in the future once I get around to playing the game. For now though [right click and select save as to download the Logitech G13 profile for Space Engineers]({{ site.url }}/media/profiles/xml/space_engineers.xml)
