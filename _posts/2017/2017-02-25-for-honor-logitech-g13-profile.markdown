excerpt: "I was able to play the beta of For Honor and I found it enjoyable once I got used to the controls. This profile should provide all the keys needed in the right spots for how often you will use them."

I played [For Honor](http://forhonor.ubisoft.com/game/en-US/home/index.aspx) as part of the beta. I enjoyed the game once I got used to the controls. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because that is what I do at this point unless the game works with my xbox 360 controller. The profile definitely helped with the special buttons closer at hand then they were with a keyboard. I found controlling the player to be easier on the keyboard than on the xbox 360 controller. I haven't picked up the game proper yet. I am waiting for the game to get less expensive before I do. Below is the image of the keyboard layout I used for the game.
