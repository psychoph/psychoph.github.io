I finally got back to playing [Assassins Creed Brotherhood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Brotherhood). The [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) has a default profile for the game, but I didn’t like the button placement for it. I modified it to be my own and below is an image of the layout. I didn’t end up using the joystick at all, but the layout worked well. I put jump on my mouse 4th button to make things easier.
