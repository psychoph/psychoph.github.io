I updated the standard [Battlefield 3](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3) [Logitech G13](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile to work better for me. I am using M1 for vehicle and normal infantry. Then M2 is for air vehicles. I may update it since the air vehicle setup doesnâ€™t work the best for helicopters, might use M1 for all but Planes.

 Below is are screen shots of the M1 key associations.
