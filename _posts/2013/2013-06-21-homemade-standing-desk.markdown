I started off with a design for my homemade standing desk based on the design found at [how to geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/128661/diy-standing-desk-sports-super-sturdy-galvanized-pipe-legs/). The designer of that standing desk made a few odd choices regarding pipe lengths and extra couplings in my opinion. The odd choices I decided to do with out were:

1. No custom cut pipe, custom cuts costs more than a regular length of pipe. Galvanized pipe comes in lengths at one inch up to 12 inches and then in 6” lengths after that.
1. Remove the couplings in the center. No matter what your height the lengths a combination of standard pipe lengths can be used to meet your height requirements with out resorting to custom cut pipe.

With these things in mind I removed several pieces from the design and focused only on standard lengths of pipe. I also moved down from 1″ pipe to ¾” pipe because is it half the price of 1” pipe and just as sturdy according to my local contractor (aka my father in law). I am also not big on aesthetics in my office (I was using an old folding table top for a desk previously) so I skipped painting. If you wanted a different look you could just buy the black galvanized pipe and skip the painting again.

I ended up not adding end caps on the feet. My desk sits on carpet and the caps seemed like a waste of money.

## Materials:

- 1 x 48" of ¾” galvanized pipe
- 4 x 24” of ¾” galvanized pipe
- 4 x 18” of ¾” galvanized pipe
- 4 x 10” of ¾” galvanized pipe (nipple)
- 4 x ¾” Galvanized floor feet
- 6 x ¾” T joints
- 4 x ¾” leveling feet
- 1 old Melamine folding table top 72” x 30”
- 16 x ½” screws

## Tools:

- 2 x Pipe wrenches
- Screw gun
- A lot of muscle power

## Extras:

* 1 x Anti-Fatigue pad (I went with [NewLife by GelPro Bio-Foam Comfort Floor Mat, 20-Inch by 32-Inch](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057GV3WQ/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1), Stone ($69.95))

I went with 24” pipe for the top section because I wanted to be able to convert the table back to a regular desk, and my regular desk needed to be at a height of roughly 35” instead of the 45” for the standing desk. So i could swap out the 18” pipe in the feet for 10” pipe and have a sitting desk in theory.

## Assembly

My process was as follows:

1. Connect the 2 T couplings to 2 10″ pipes on the left and right sides
2. Connect the 2 T couplings to the 48″ pipe, this should form your center H

The anti-fatigue pad was a bit pricey, aka more than the desk itself, but it was the only one i could find that was thicker than ½”.
