I grabbed a copy of [Borderlands 2](http://www.borderlands2.com/us/) when it was on sale at [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/). I really hate the default profile for most games on the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard). I wrong my own copy of the profile in order to make it more like the other first person shooters I play. Below is a screen capture of the keyboard layout I am using for the Logitech G13.
