I just started playing [Assassins Creed Revelations](http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-revelations/) since I finished brotherhood and got the game cheap a while back on steam. The Logitech G13 didn’t have a default profile for the game. I cloned the Assassins Creed Brotherhood [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile and added the V key for eagle vision because that was the only new key. I didn’t end up using the joystick at all, but the layout worked well. I put jump on my mouse 4th button to make things easier.
