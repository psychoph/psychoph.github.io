I wasn’t happy with the default [Rift](http://www.riftgame.com/en/) [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile so I modified it to what I wanted. My plan is ultimately to have M1 be a non pet class and M2 before pet class characters. I don’t have a character that is a pet class yet so all I have modified is the M1 key. I usually put jump on my extra mouse button, but with Rift I decided to put shift and alt there to give access to more quick toolbars. I updated my Rift keybinding to bind shift 1 to = to the second action bar and alt + 1 to = to the third action bar. Below is the keyboard layout for M1 as well as my mouse layout.
