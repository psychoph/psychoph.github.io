Since [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) added cards I have been playing a few more games I haven’t really planned to. [Red orchestra 2 Heroes of Stalingrad](http://www.heroesofstalingrad.com/) is one of the. I wasn’t happy with the default [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile layout. So I made my own Red Orchestra 2 Logitech G13 Profile. As usually jump and melee are on my mouse’s 3rd and 4th buttons for this. The rest I kept pretty much standard with my layouts. The Run key is on G15, the Interact key on G3, and the Movement keys for G4 and G10-G12. You can see a screen shot of the layout below:

I think the layout improves your access to the keys you are going to need access to quickly. I haven’t really played multiple player so I am not positive how useful the widgets are.
