I started playing [Blacklight Retribution](http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/blacklight-retribution) when I saw it was free to play. The game was a lot of fun, but I didn't find a default [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile. I created it in order to take advantage of the keyboard in game making it easier to play. Below is a screenshot of my keyboard layout.
