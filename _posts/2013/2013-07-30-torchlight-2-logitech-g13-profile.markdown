I have been on a roll today. Played some [Torchlight 2](http://www.torchlight2game.com/) and made a Torchlight 2 [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) Profile. As always I didnâ€™t like the default profile. I placed all the early quick slots in the movement keys and then added the best health potion to G8 and best mana potion to G13. I am not sure about the placement of swap weapon and primary skill, but for the 2 hours I played they seemed to work fine. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout.
