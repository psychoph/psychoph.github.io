I started playing [Batman Arkham Asylum](http://www.amazon.com/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-Playstation-3/dp/B001E8VB6O) again because I got Arkham city as part of a Humble Bundle. I figured I needed to finish the first before playing the second. Because of this I made a profile to use my [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard). I tried to use my Logitech gaming pad and it was going to be a pain in the butt because the game is setup for an XBOX 360 controller. Someday I might just switch to one of those. The profile is very simple, there arenâ€™t a lot of buttons in Batman. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout. I put grapple on my mouse 5th button. You might have to modify the profile to point to your install of batman because I installed it on my D drive for [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) and not the C drive because my C drive is a SSD that is pretty loaded up.
