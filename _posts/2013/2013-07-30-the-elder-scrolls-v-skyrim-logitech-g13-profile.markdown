[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim) is another game that [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) cards has gotten me playing again. I haven’t played it since I bought my [Logitech G13 Gaming Pad](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard). So of course the default profile did not suit my needs at all. And that means I created my own Skyrim Logitech G13 Profile. I stuck with what I am considering my standard layout. With movement on the keys and sprint on G15. Interact on G3 and so forth. It might need a little work as I find i keep having to use the keyboard to exit screens. Below is a screen shot of what the keyboard layout looks like:
