Since I just got my [Logitech G13](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) gamepad I have started making some profiles. It doesn’t look like there are all that many out there in the community. At least I couldn’t find them quickly. So I figured I would start adding them to my blog for later. This way I can link to them from other sites.

I got [Firefall](http://www.firefall.com) as part of the beta and enjoyed it so I made a profile for it. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout.
