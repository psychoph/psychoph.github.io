After playing more and more with the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) I have grown accustom to having the movement keys on G4 and G10-12. The Lord of the Rings Online Logitech G13 Profile I had created originally used the joystick for movement. I find this pretty difficulty to control in game. So I made the Lord of the Rings Online Logitech G13 Alternate Profile. This one the movement keys are G4 and G10-12. I put the shift and ctrl keys on my mouse buttons as well. Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout.
