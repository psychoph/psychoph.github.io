After I had issues with the battery charger not charging I decided to just ditch it, the battery has a loose connection for charging you have to force is downwards to get it to work. This simplified the design a lot. Below is a diagram of the new connections."

After this last trip back home I have come up with a Revised RPI Car Media Center. After I had issues with the battery charger not charging I decided to just ditch it, the battery has a loose connection for charging you have to force is downwards to get it to work. This simplified the design a lot. Below is a diagram of the new connections.

It may look complex but it is actually pretty simple in the box. I actually remove the cell phone and plug it into another USB port just so I can take it out when we get out of the car. [Xbian](http://www.xbian.org/) worked splendidly. It was able to handle the hard boot without any issues. It reconnected to the wifi as well this out trouble. [Yaste](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree&hl=en) also worked like a dream. We were able to do the 13 hour car trip without one issue, my self and my non technical wife. I have now moved on to buying [Play Later](http://www.playlater.tv/) to download more tv shows form Amazon prime instant video for my kids to watch in the car. I think i may end up being forced to upgrade the hard drive.
