I started playing [Defiance](http://www.defiance.com/en/welcome-to-defiance/?rc=EYHYKRPJDQ2RFCX3CPWZ) and of course I am using my [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard). Since there wasn’t an existing profile I just made my own Defiance Logitech G13 Profile. The profile is my standard FPS layout. I put the social menu on the joystick to make it easy to access those menus. I think the Esc key is probably the only button I am really missing. The configuration has worked well so far for all of the different power sets. I put melee and jump on my mouse side keys, typical FPS for me, and they have worked well both for PVE and PVP. Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout.
