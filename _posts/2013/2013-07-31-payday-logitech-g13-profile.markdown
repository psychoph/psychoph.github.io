[Payday](http://www.overkillsoftware.com/games/payday-the-heist/) is yet another game that I darted playing because of the [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) cards and because I hadn’t played it enough really. I created the PayDay [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) Profile because there wasn’t a default one and I didn’t want to use my keyboard. It is pretty much my default layout but I like customizing and the color changing so I made a PayDay specific layout. You can see a screen shot of the key bindings below.
