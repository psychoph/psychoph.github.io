My wife and her mother really like sweet barbecue. I came up with the following rub I have called the Apple Pie Rub to meet their taste buds. I have used it on beef, pork and tofu with success. I wouldn’t suggest it for chicken or fish however. I call this the apple pie rub because it reminds me of an apple pie with the cinnamon, sugar, allspice, nutmeg and cloves. I usually let the rub site for 12 hours in the fridge. The recipe is as follows:

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Brown sugar
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp cloves
- 1/2 tsp all spice
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp white pepper
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder

## Optional Ingredients

- 1/2 tsp Cayenne pepper

We have paired this rub with a couple of off the shelf barbecue sauces and plain. It seems to pair well with the sweeter sauces. We have used the rub for grilling and smoking. I smoked this rub with hickory and apple chips. Both we very successful. My next experiment with this rub is to add a barbecue sauce moping during the smoking process. Below are some smoked ribs with the apple pie rub and my wife’s happy face.
