Since I have a lifetime membership to Champions online I was able to get into the beta weekend for [Neverwinter](http://nw.perfectworld.com/). After playing 10 minutes I put together a [Logitech g13](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile. The layout is simple because Neverwinter’s controls are simple. This isn’t much more than i would normally do for a FPS keyboard layout with movement and the dailies. I have found that this works very well for a Guardian, rogue and healer. I haven’t played a fighter or mage yet but I think it will still work.

Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout.
