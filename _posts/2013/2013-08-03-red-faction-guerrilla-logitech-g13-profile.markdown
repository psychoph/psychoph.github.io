The [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) has no default profile for [Red Faction Guerrilla](http://rfg.redfaction.com/). I created a Red Faction Guerrilla Logitech G13 Profile just because I started playing today and I needed a profile. There are not a lot of keys in Red Faction Guerrilla, but the layout in the screenshot below worked for me and didnâ€™t require a keyboard.
