I started playing [World of Tanks](http://worldoftanks.com/) as part of the free stuff that came with my [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html) video card. My Logitech G13 did not have a default profile for the game. I put together a World of Tanks Logitech G13 profile. Below is a screen show of the keyboard layout.
