excerpt: "I have created a collection of free battlemaps that of a single floor of a building. The first floor maps connect to the second-floor maps by either a set of stairs at the top of the map or the middle of the map.  Dungeon Masters can swap out the first or second floor to make many combinations of two-story buildings."

I have created a collection of free battlemaps that of a single floor of a building. The first floor maps connect to the second-floor maps by either a set of stairs at the top of the map or the middle of the map.  Dungeon Masters can swap out the first or second floor to make many combinations of two-story buildings.
Do you want a tavern with offices above in the rich part of town? Use the expensive tavern first-floor map and then the expensive office's second-floor map. Need a seedy tavern with apartments above it? Use the cheap tavern first-floor map with the apartment's second-floor map. Currently, there are three different types of maps taverns, offices, apartments, and one inn. I am working on adding feasthalls, shop fronts, and warehouses to the mix over time.
I have posted each map on my [Patreon page under the filter Modular](https://www.patreon.com/detailingtherealm/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=Modular). Each map is 20 X 12 squares. I exported each map with and without lighting, with grids, gridless and a single square grid, three different resolutions, and pdf versions of the map in letter and A4 format (for US and EU players). All of the assets in the maps are from the [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/detailingtherealm/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=Modular) asset packs.
If people like the work, I would be overjoyed to have you become a patron and support me, [Detailing the Realm's Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/detailingtherealm/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=Modular). I plan to expand the modular maps to include feasthalls and warehouses over time.
