I have created a collection of free battlemaps of the Sleeping Slyph in Waterdeep. Neither TSR nor WoTC have published an official map of the Sleepy Slyph. These battlemaps are, therefore, original.
I based the maps of the buildings and the street corner on the city of Waterdeep map and scaled them up to 5 ft per square inch. Each map is 15 X 15 squares. I exported each map with and without lighting, with grids, gridless and a single square grid, three different resolutions, and pdf versions of the map in letter and A4 format (for US and EU players). I have also added with this release a high-resolution version of the maps. All of the assets in the maps are from the [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/detailingtherealm/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=Modular) asset packs.
You can read about the maps in more depth and download them on my [Patreon post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/39753221). If you like my work, I would be overjoyed if you became a patron and support me. You can find out more about patronage on my Patreon page, [Detailing the Realm](https://www.patreon.com/detailingtherealm/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=Modular).
