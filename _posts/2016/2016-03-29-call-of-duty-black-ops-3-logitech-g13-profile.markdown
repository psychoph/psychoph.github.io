I picked up [Call of Duty Black Ops 3](https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3) when the disc version went on sale on (Amazon)[http://www.amazon.com] and there wasn't a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it. I created one and it worked well for the single player missions. I am just starting to test it out in multiplayer. So far it is working, but I haven't gotten a good kill streak that would let me test if I had the right keys mapped to the analog stick for those. This is similar to what I did with Call of Duty Ghosts (I lost that profile in a reformating of my computer to install Windows 10). Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout for the game. I put melee and jump as always on my extra mouse buttons.
