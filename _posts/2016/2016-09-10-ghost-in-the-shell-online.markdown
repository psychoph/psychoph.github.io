I started playing [Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online](http://firstassault.nexon.net/) after I grabbed it off of the E3 2016 Digital Ticket [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com). Of course it doesn't have a default profile for the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) so I ended up creating one. I am definitley enjoying the game it is a fun free to play FPS. I have the keyboard configured just like a typical first person shooter and then I added support for the skills that you can use in the game. The skills and sharing them adds a different element to the game that makes it interesting compared to other FPSs. I doubt I will play too much more of it however because I have so many other games I have picked up since. Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout.
