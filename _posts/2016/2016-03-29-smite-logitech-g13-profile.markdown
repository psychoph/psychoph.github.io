I started playing [Smite](http://www.bioshock2game.com/en/) after I grabbed a Loki god pack off of a [Humble Bundle]() sale. I have been enjoying it so much I picked up the (Ultimate God pack)[http://store.steampowered.com/app/387440/] off Steam when it was 50% off. Of course it doesn't have a default profile for the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) so I ended up creating one. I like the layout and have played about 15 games with it so far. I am not a heavy consumables or relic player at the moment so there might be better or more useful placements for those buttons. I could also see changing the 4 ability keys if you use a specific god and have a sequence you use. I put consumable 1 on my second mouse key along with jump. I really don't know that jump is at all useful in that game so I would consider putting consumable 2 or both the relic keys on my mouse. Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout.
