I bought [Starforge](http://www.starforge.com/#) off of [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) when it was on sale. The game is still in alpha but it is interesting to play. It is a building/survival game like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) which is interesting to me. Just like with Minecraft the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) works really well with the game. As with most of my profiles I have put Jump on my mouse. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout for the profile.
