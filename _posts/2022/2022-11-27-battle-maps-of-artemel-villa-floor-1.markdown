### Map Overview

This map is of the first floor of all of the buildings in the Artemel Villa. I have tried to provide a purpose for all of the buildings along with how I see each of the rooms being used by the family. I have a DM's map with numbers on it that correspond to the descriptions below:

1. **Main House:** this is where the patriarch and matriarch live and where the family host parties.
   1. **Foyer:** this room is the grand entrance to the main house with a balcony above the downstairs. The family uses this to welcome guests and family that has come from out of town.
   1. **Kitchen:** the servants use this area to prepare meals for the family and dinner parties.
   1. **Meeting room:** the family uses this room to meet with guests and any members of Waterdeep that come calling.
   1. **Grand Dining Hall:** the family uses this as their main dining room for parties and when receiving important people for dinner. The room is also used for larger family dinners.
   1. **Secondary Dining Room:** the family uses this dining room for most meals when just the members of the house are eating a meal.
2. **Guest House:** this is where the Artemel family puts up guests that need to stay for a period of time.
   1. **Foyer:** this room is used as a sitting area for guests to lounge when not in their rooms, at a meal or a party.
   1. **Restrooms:** these rooms contain the toilets for all of the guests or those in the main house. The toilets run to the sewer.
   1. **Dining room:** Guests use this room to dine when not dining with the family.
   1. **Kitchen:** the servants use this area to prepare meals for guests and if needed any parties.
   1. **Servants room:** the family uses this room for any servants of guests who are staying over. The servants can meet here as needed and have a meal.
3. **Servants House:** this is where the servants for the family live and entertain themselves when not working for the family.
   1. **Foyer:** this room is a simple area that provides access to the other rooms of the first floor.
   1. **Kitchen:** the servants use this area to prepare meals for themselves.
   1. **Servants Dining Room:** the servants use this room to eat their meals when not serving the family.
   1. **Meeting Room:** the servants use this room to meet with each other and anyone they need to acquire goods and services from for the family.
4. **Tertiary Family House:** this building is where the least important family members reside.
   1. **Foyer:** this room provides a comfortable entrance to the home and access to all rooms on this floor and the stairs to the next floor.
   1. **Restrooms:** these rooms contain the toilets for everyone that is staying at the house at the time and servants as needed. The toilets run to the sewer.
   1. **Kitchen:** the servants use this area to prepare small meals for family members who are not eating in the main or secondary houses.
   1. **Small Dining Room:** the family uses this room to eat when they want a small meal with only their immediate family members.
   1. **Reading Room:** the family uses this room to relax and read or as a small meeting area.
   1. **Small Dining Room:** the family uses this room to eat when they want a small meal with only their immediate family members.
5. **Guard House:** this is where the Artemel family house their guards and weaponry.
   1. **On Duty Room:** The guards use this room to stay during the cold winter nights when they are not out patrolling the grounds.
6. **Secondary Family House:** this building is where the sons and daughters of the current ruling family members reside with their family or by themselves.
   1. **Foyer:** this room provides a comfortable entrance to the home and access to all rooms on this floor and the stairs to the next floor.
   2. **Kitchen:** the servants use this area to prepare meals for the family.
   3. **Dining Room:** the family uses this room to dine in as well as to host dinner events when they are too large to occur in just the main house.
   4. **Restrooms:** these rooms contain the toilets for all of the people staying at the house or those in the main house. The toilets run to the sewer.
   5. **Dining Room:** the family uses this room to dine in as well as to host dinner events when they are too large to occur in just the main house.

### Map Options

Each map is 36 X 32 squares and without lighting, because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variant combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/) asset packs. I am a patron of Forgotten Adventures, and fifty percent of your Patreon donations support Forgotten Adventures' continued asset development. You will need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
