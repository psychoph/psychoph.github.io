excerpt: "Continuing with maps from the Mere of Dead Men adventures this map is of the swamp lake around Uthtower. The map is for the last Adventure in the series Eye of Myrkul from Dungeon Magainze #73. The darker area in the middle of the map is where the tower will rise in the coming maps. I used the map to turn the encounter with the Darktentecles and Sewerms."

### Map Overview

Continuing with maps from the Mere of Dead Men adventures this map is of the swamp lake around Uthtower. The map is for the last Adventure in the series Eye of Myrkul from Dungeon Magainze #73. The darker area in the middle of the map is where the tower will rise in the coming maps. I used the map to turn the encounter with the Darktentecles and Sewerms. I used Giant coral snakes for the Sewerms and a Tumbler posted [Darktentacles](https://thirdtofifth.tumblr.com/post/177286840379/darktentacles-large-aberration-unaligned-armor) with some modifications.

### Map Options

Each map is 40 X 40 squares and without lighting because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variants combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/) asset packs. Fifty percent of all Patreon donations are used to patron Forgotten Adventures to support their continued assest development. You will need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
