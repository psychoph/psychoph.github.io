### Map Overview

Starting to find my new process with work and the addition of new dogs. Lots to remember after a long break. This map is going back to a map I created a few years ago and updating it to the new resources and methods of map creation. I am adding the grounds map here to the collection including the two exterior buildings. I have a DM's map with numbers on it that correspond to the descriptions below:

1. **Guard House:** this building is where the guards for the family live and maintain the protection detail for the main house.
2. **Main Villa**: this building is where the family lives and entertain guests.
3. **Guest House**: this building is where the family houses guests who stay for a period of time. Guests need to leave through the side gate and enter from the front gate, this is to increase security for the family.

### Map Options

Each map is 32 X 30 squares and without lighting, because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variant combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/) asset packs. I am a patron of Forgotten Adventures, and fifty percent of your Patreon donations support Forgotten Adventures' continued asset development. You will need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
