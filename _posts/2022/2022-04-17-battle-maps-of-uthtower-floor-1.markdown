### Map Overview

This map is of the first floor of Uthtower after it has risen during the Eye of Myrkul in the Dungeon Magazine #73 adventure Eye of Myrkul. The tower is just an island in the lake of the swamp from the previous post Uthtower Sunken. I have a players map and a DM's map with numbers on it that correspond to the descriptions below:

1. **Uthtower**: The description of the floor in the tower is on pages 39-40 in the Dungeon Magazine
   1. **Gatehouse**: this separates the path from the tower and has an encounter with champion skeletons.
   2. **Greathall**: This is the largest room on the first floor and provides access to the stairs to the next floor and down to the Mausoleum.
   3. **Barracks**: This room is where the soldiers stayed, but it under a couple feet of water and all the beds are destroyed
   4. **Armory**: This is the room where the weapons were stored when the tower was in use. There is water and most of the weapons are rusted and useless.

### Map Options

Each map is 40 X 40 squares and without lighting because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variants combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/](Forgotten Adventures) asset packs. Fifty percent of all Patreon donations are used to patron Forgotten Adventures to support their continued assest development. You will need [https://www.7-zip.org](7zip) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
