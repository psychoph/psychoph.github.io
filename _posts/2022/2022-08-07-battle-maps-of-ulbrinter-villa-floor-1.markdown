### Map Overview

These maps are the start of the playable maps for the Ulbrinter Family Villa and represent the first floor of the three buildings on the property. I changed up the distribution to put all three images in the same 7zip file. I realized I had been zipping single images, which made very little sense. I am also working on a process for creating a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) and [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/) module for all of the maps I have created. I have a DM's map with numbers on it that correspond to the descriptions below:

1. **Guard House:** this building is where the guards for the family live and maintain the protection detail for the main house.
   1. **Watch Room:** this room is where the guards stay to watch the house and guests as they enter the villa. The hallway contains the stairs to the second floor of the house.
   2. **Kitchen:** this room is where the cooks make food for the dining rooms in the main villa.
   3. **Restrooms:** this room is where those living upstairs and working in the watch room go to the bathroom.
2. **Main Villa:** this building is where the family lives and entertains guests.
   1. **Storage room:** this room is used for deliveries and storage for the food used by the house. The side door makes for easy delivery and the guards sleeping in the next room protect the goods and family.
   2. **Guard’s bedroom:** this room is where some of the guards and help sleep. Bunk beds allow for up to eight people to sleep.
   3. **Family bedroom:** this room is one of the bedrooms for a family member, likely a son or daughter.
   4. **Dining room:** this room is one of the dining rooms that the family uses for meals as well as for family parties. This rooms also contains the only access to the second floor of the villa.
   5. **Help eating room:** this room is for storage and where the help can eat when they need to.
   6. **Dining room:** this room is used by the family for dinner parties and other large gatherings.
   7. **Dining room:** this room is used by the family for large gatherings and when family members want to eat separately.
   8. **Family bedroom:** this room is one of the bedrooms for a family member, likely a son or daughter.
   9. **Family bedroom:** this room is one of the bedrooms for a family member, likely a son or daughter.
3. **Guest House:** this building is where the family houses guests who stay for a period of time. Guests need to leave through the side gate and enter from the front gate, this is to increase security for the family.
   1. **Entryway:** this room is the entry to the guest house and has stairs leading to the second floor of the guest house.
   2. **Dining room:** this room is used for guests to eat when the family doesn’t want to prepare a special meal with their guests.
   3. **Kitchen:** this room is used to cook food for the guests.
   4. **Restrooms:** this room is used as the restroom for guests.

### Map Options

Each map is 32 X 30 squares and without lighting, because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variant combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/) asset packs. I am a patron of Forgotten Adventures, and fifty percent of your Patreon donations support Forgotten Adventures' continued asset development. You will need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
