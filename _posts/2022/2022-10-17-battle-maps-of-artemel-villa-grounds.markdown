### Map Overview

With this release I am continuing with the family villas in Waterdeep. I skipped over the Anteos family because I need to remeasure the map to make sure my building dimensions are right, their villa has a lot of odd angles. As the title explains this is the Artemel villa in Waterdeep off Sul Street. I have a DM's map with numbers on it that correspond to the descriptions below:

1. **Main House:** this is where the patriarch and matriarch live and where the family host parties.
1. **Guest House:** this is where the Artemel family puts up guests that need to stay for a period of time.
1. **Servants House:** this is where the servants for the family live and entertain themselves when not working for the family.
1. **Tertiary Family House:** this building is where the least important family members reside.
1. **Guard House:** this is where the Artemel family house their guards and weaponry.
1. **Secondary Family House:** this building is where the sons and daughters of the current ruling family members reside with their family or by themselves.

### Map Options

Each map is 36 X 32 squares and without lighting, because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variant combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/) asset packs. I am a patron of Forgotten Adventures, and fifty percent of your Patreon donations support Forgotten Adventures' continued asset development. You will need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
