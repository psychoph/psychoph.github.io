### Map Overview

Here is the final map for the Ulbrinter villa. The second floors of the buildings mostly house bedrooms. I changed some of the map from the original design to add more furniture that I thought was more appropriate. I have a DM's map with numbers on it that correspond to the descriptions below:

1. **Guard House:** this building is where the guards for the family live and maintain the protection detail for the main house.
1. **Servant’s Bedroom:** this room is used for the female servants to sleep.
1. **Servant’s Bedroom:**this room is used for the male servants to sleep.
1. **Main Villa::** this building is where the family lives and entertains guests.
1. **Family Member’s:** this room is used by the head of the and their significant other.
1. **Storage Room:** The family stores various collectible items in this room that they aren’t current;y displaying in other areas of the Villa.
1. **Storage Room:** The family stores random odds and ends in this room or any large shipments that need to be secured.
1. **Dining Room:** This room is one of the dining rooms the family uses for more private meals.
1. **Storage Room:** The family stores non-perishable food in this room and alcohol.
1. **Servant Eating Room:** The servants can eat in here in between serving the family dining rooms. They can also use this room as a stop over when serving meals.
1. **Dining Room:** The family will use this room for more private meals.
1. **Family Bedroom:** This room is used by the children of one of the family members
1. **Family Bedroom:** This room is used by the parents of the children in room 2h.
1. **Family Bedroom:** This room is used by another set of family members.
1. **Guest House:** this building is where the family houses guests who stay for a period of time. Guests need to leave through the side gate and enter from the front gate, this is to increase security for the family.
1. **Sitting Room:** Guests can use this room to relax and have conversations when not in their rooms or the main house.
1. **Guest Bedroom:** A single guest would stay in this room.
1. **Guest Bedroom:** A couple or someone demanding a larger space to stay would use this room.
1. **Guest Bedroom:** A couple would likely reside in this room when staying with the family.

### Map Options

Each map is 32 X 30 squares and without lighting, because most VTTs support adding lighting to a map. I create several versions of each map based on if it is a city or terrain map. I create a summer and winter version of city maps and grass, sand, snow, and forest versions for terrain maps where it makes sense.

I have created several map variant combinations from these original maps and grouped them into 7zip files for download. I group the download links by file extension first; currently, I export maps into the WEBP and PDF file formats. I then group the WEBP downloads by the audience (dungeon master or players), grid type (with and without), and color contrast/brightness (original and high contrast). I group the PDF downloads using the WEBP groups and these other PDF groups and page size (Letter for US and A4 for EU) and border (small 0.25-inch border or no border).

I created the maps using [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures/) asset packs. I am a patron of Forgotten Adventures, and fifty percent of your Patreon donations support Forgotten Adventures' continued asset development. You will need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) to extract the images of PDFs.

Below are the various image and PDF download groups. A file in the WEBPs section named players no contrast no grid contains all of the city or terrain images for players with the original color contrast and no grid. A file in the PDFs section named dm high-contrast full-grid letter small-border contains all city or terrain images for a dungeon master in high contrast with grid squares every inch in the letter page size with a 0.25-inch border.
