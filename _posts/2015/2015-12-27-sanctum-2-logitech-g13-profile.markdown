I started playing [Sanctum 2](http://www.coffeestainstudios.com/games/sanctum-2) to get the [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/210770/) cards to get the badge. I really like this game compared to the original. It is a lot easier to play multiplayer with complete strangers. I created a  [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile because there wasn't a default one. The keyboard is pretty barren because there aren't a lot of keys in this game, which is a good thing. The thing you should notice is that there isn't a crouch key, instead I placed the start the round key there. It has worked well so far in my 7 hours of playing. Below are the images of the keyboard and mouse so you can see how I have set them up before you download the profile.
