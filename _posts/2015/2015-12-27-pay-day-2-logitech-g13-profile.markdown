I have been playing [Pay Day 2](http://www.crimenet.info/) for a while but forgot to put up the profile for it because it has been a busy year. I recently worked to get the [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/218620/) cards to get the badge for the game which reminded me I needed to put the profile up. I really like this game compared to the original. The addition of crime net and the DLCs keeps making the game interesting. I created a  [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile because there wasn't a default one. The keyboard is pretty barren because there aren't a lot of keys in this game, which is a good thing. The mouse is my typical FPS layout with melee and jump on my extra 2 mouse buttons. Below is the image of the keyboard layout so you can see how I have set it up before you download the profile.
