I started playing [Warhammer 40k Space Marines](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/55150/) again when I saw that [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) had a badge for it and I was able to find a multiplayer game. It turns out if you select Versus then Seize Ground and then select Dreadnought Assault sometimes you can find a single server out there on the Internet to play on. I would still not recommend buying this game unless you want to play the campaign, which is fun, but only about 5 or 6 hours of game place. I created a  [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile because the default one that you find is less than useless. It will get you killed a lot in multiplayer. Below is are the images of the keyboard and mouse layout for the profile because it is different than most first person shooters.
