I bought [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home) when it was 50% off a couple of months ago. I have put over 150 hours into this game since October, and I am only level 45. The game itself is getting repetitive at this level, but I can't seem to stop playing it. This game is well worth the money I spent on it ($30 for 150 hours). It is still not officially released, I don't know how I feel about that, and there are issues with the game (it currently produces a crash report every time I quit the game). They have a consistent release cadence and have events every couple of months that change up your goals. I wouldn't buy a higher level founder pack because you can earn loot lamas quickly especially with the event lamas.
I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because one didn't exist. The profile works well in Save the World mode, I haven't tried Battle Royale, but I assume the keys are the same. For Battle Royale, you might want to change up the joystick to make it quicker to switch weapons and to drop items (at least that seems to be critical based on Youtube videos I have watched). If I ever play Battle Royale, I will add an M2 layout if the layout needs to be different. Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout I created.
