I bought the [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) for the next two weeks and one of the games that came with it is [Spec Ops the Line](http://www.specopstheline.com/us/). I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because I don’t like playing anything that is a shooting game with a game pad. The game’s controls were different enough from most first person shooters that my default profile wasn’t going to work. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout. I only attached melee to my mouse 4th button.
