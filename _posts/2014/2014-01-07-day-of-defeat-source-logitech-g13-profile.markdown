I ended up playing [Day of Defeat Source](http://www.dayofdefeat.com/) to get the Steam cards. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for the game. It is a little different from most of the profiles I make because prone is on the G13 key, and usually that is the grenade key. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout.
