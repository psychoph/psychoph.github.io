I played the beta for [Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Phantoms](http://ghost-recon.ubi.com/ghost-recon-phantoms/en-us/home/) and it was pretty good. It is different than your typical free to play FPS. It has some fun elements, but is limited to only 2 maps to play on, which can get boring. I made a profile for it for the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard). It is a basic FPS profile with a few special keys and there is no grenade key in the game. Below is a screenshot of the profiles setup.
