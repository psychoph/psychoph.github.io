I finished Batman Arkham Asylum and started [Batman Arkham City](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200260/) and the controls changed enough that I needed to create a new [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile. Below is the keyboard layout. I put grapple and zoom on my mouseâ€™s extra buttons. So far I like the keyboard and mouse better than my XBOX 360 controller.
