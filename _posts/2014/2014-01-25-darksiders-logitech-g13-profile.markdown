I started playing [Darksiders](http://community.darksiders.com/forum/viewboard) again to finish the storyline. I had issues with my XBOX 360 controller not working with the game. I am assuming it has something to do with the [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) being plugged in. I have had this issue with a lot of older games. So I just created a Logitech G13 profile. I am finding that I have more control with the keyboard and mouse than I did with my Logitech gaming pad. Below is the keyboard layout.
