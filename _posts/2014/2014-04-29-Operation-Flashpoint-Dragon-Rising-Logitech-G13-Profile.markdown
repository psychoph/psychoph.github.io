As one of the [Humble Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/) I picked up the Operation Flashpoint games. I made up a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard)  profile for [Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising](http://www.codemasters.com/uk/ofdr-uk/pc/) because there wasn’t a default profile. I have only played 30 minutes, but so far I like the profile. It gives quick access to the command menu and lets you select soldiers to give commands to easily using the joystick. I did add the = key because I didn’t’ understand what the ADD key was for zoom. I didn’t actually assign this to a key. I assigned stand and focus to my extra mouse buttons. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard and mouse layouts.
