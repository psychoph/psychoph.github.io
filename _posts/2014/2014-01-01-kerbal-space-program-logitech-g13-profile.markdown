A friend bought me a copy for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/) for the holiday season. Naturally i created a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it. It is a pretty basic profile since most of the game uses the mouse for interaction. The profile is only useful once you have started the launch process for a shuttle. I haven’t tried moon landing yet, which means I don’t know if the profile needs to be updated to support this. Below is an image of the keyboard layout.
