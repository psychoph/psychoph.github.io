I found that as I was working on an [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) project that if you are not using Nodejs there are some rules you need to create to use Angularjsâ€™s html5mode. For Apache you need to add the following rewrite rule to a .htaccess file or virtualhost.

{% highlight conf linenos %}
<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !index
    RewriteRule (.*) index.html [L]
</IfModule>
{% endhighlight %}

I credit this to Joss Crowcroft with his [post](http://www.josscrowcroft.com/2012/code/htaccess-for-html5-history-pushstate-url-routing/) that I found on stackoverflow.
