The [Origin store](https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/) was running a 48 hour free play for [Titanfall](http://www.titanfall.com/) this weekend and I decided to try out the game to see if it was worth the $30 they were selling it for. In the process I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile. The profile is similar to most FPS profiles I have made with jump and melee on the mouse. Titanfall has some unique keys with the Titan interaction and each classâ€™s special ability. The G13 works really well for the game though compared to the keyboard setup I saw in the game.  Below is a screenshot of the keyboard layout.
