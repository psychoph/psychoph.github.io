I started playing [Saints Row: The Third](http://www.saintsrow.com/) again because of the Steam trading cards and I hadn’t finished it. I made a simple [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for the game. I think it might also work for Saints Row the Fourth, but I don’t own that game so I am not positive. Below is an image of the keyboard layout for the profile.
