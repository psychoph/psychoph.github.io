I got [Arma II](http://www.arma2.com/) when it was on sale recently and because a friend recommend the [DayZ](http://dayzmod.com/) mod. I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for the game because one didn’t exist by default. Arma 2 has one of the more complex FPS keyboard layouts I have seen, probably because of its real world simulation focus. I placed the general actions for when you are running around and in a tank or motor vehicle on the M1 key. I then put helicopter and jet controls on the M2 key. This is similar to what I did with Battlefield 3. Below is a screenshot of each of the M keyboard layouts.
