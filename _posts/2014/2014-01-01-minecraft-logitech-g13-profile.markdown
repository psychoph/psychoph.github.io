I have always been a fan of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). I realized today that I haven’t posted my [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for Minecraft yet to the site. Below is what the keyboard layout looks like. I plus jump on my 5th button for the mouse. I usually don’t use the number keys, but they are there is anyone else wants to use them.
