I bought the [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) for the next two weeks and one of the games that came with it is [The Bureau Xcom Declassified](http://www.thebureau-game.com/us/). I made a [Logitech G13](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g13-advanced-gameboard) profile for it because I don’t like playing anything that is a shooting game with a game pad. The game’s controls included the ability to give orders to party members. I put all the crew orders on the joystick, but so far I haven’t used them. Below is a screen shot of the keyboard layout. I attached the go to and follow orders to my mouse’s 4th and 5th buttons respectively..
