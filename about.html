      I am a Product Manager during the weekdays. I used to be a programmer, but
      now I just dabble in writing scripts that improve my life. This site is my
      personal blog and represents only my opinions and hobbies not those of my
      employer. The blog is here to house my personal projects for role-playing,
      video games, programming, DIY and cooking. I also like to post notes here
      about things I learned during my programming experiences at work or with
      personal projects. I often times write posts on answers to problems that
      caused me some headaches or time to resolve. For me the resolution is the
      key and the blog post is there to keep me from repeating the same mistake
      twice. I have also started up my own Patreon where I post FREE battlemaps
      for Forgotten Realms. I will link to those posts from this site as well.
